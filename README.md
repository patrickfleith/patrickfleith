## Hi there 👋

Hi, my name is Patrick, 31, French 🇫🇷, a passionated Data Scientist with Space Engineering domain expertise. 

### Open-Source

- I built [datafast](https://patrickfleith.github.io/datafast/) an open-source python package for high-quality synthetic text data generation for LLM projects.
- I make domain-specific [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/work/datasets) for the community, because I love to empower teams with better data.

### Day Job

- 💼 My job at Solenix is to build AI systems for Space Mission Design and Operations for clients like the European Space Agency.

### Others
